        <h3>Why are they being compared?</h3>
        <p>In a 2014 interview, Charli XCX was asked about the inspiration behind “Royals”. Many compare Charli and Lorde due to their similar musical styles and curly hair.</p>
        <p><strong>Charli XCX</strong> = curly hair + singer | <strong>Lorde</strong> = curly hair + singer</p>
        <p>Does Charli XCX equal Lorde?</p>
        <p><strong>Charli was constantly comparing herself to the mainstream success that Lorde had reached.</strong></p>

        <h3>Lyrics</h3>
        <pre>
[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Girl, it's so confusing sometimes to be a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, it's so confusing sometimes to be a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, how do you feel being a girl?
Girl, girl, girl
How do you feel being a girl?
Girl, girl, girl
Man, I don't know, I'm just a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
Yeah, I don't know if you like me
Sometimes I think you might hate me
Sometimes I think I might hate you
Maybe you just wanna be me
You always say, "Let's go out"
So we go eat at a restaurant
Sometimes it feels a bit awkward
'Cause we don't have much in common

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
People say we're alike
They say we've got the same hair
We talk about making music
But I don't know if it's honest
Can't tell if you wanna see me
Falling over and failing
And you can't tell what you're feeling
I think I know how you feel

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Girl, it's so confusing sometimes to be a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, it's so confusing sometimes to be a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, how do you feel being a girl?
Girl, girl, girl
How do you feel being a girl?
Girl, girl, girl
Man, I don't know, I'm just a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl

[Verse 2: Lorde]
Well, honestly, I was speechless
When I woke up to your voice note
You told me how you'd been feeling
Let's work it out on the remix
You'd always say, "Let's go out"
But then I'd cancel last minute
I was so lost in my head
And scared to be in your pictures

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX & Lorde]
People say we're alike
They say we've got the same hair
It's you and me on the coin
The industry loves to spend
And when we put this to bed
The internet will go crazy
I'm glad I know how you feel
'Cause I ride for you, Charli

[Chorus: Charli XCX & Lorde]
Girl, it's so confusing sometimes to be a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, it's so confusing sometimes to be a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, how do you feel being a girl?
Girl, girl, girl
How do you feel being a girl?
Girl, girl, girl
Man, I don't know, I'm just a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
